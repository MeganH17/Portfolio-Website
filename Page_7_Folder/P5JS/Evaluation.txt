PROPOSAL: 
Shooter Cat is an action-packed adventure where players control Ninja Cat, a stealthy hero on a mission to reclaim stolen treasure from the notorious Dog Clan. Dressed in a sleek black suit with glowing green eyes and armed with precision skills, Ninja Cat navigates the shadows, shooting enemies and evading guards across the Dog Clan’s stronghold. The journey begins with a short comic that introduces the peaceful cat village now under threat. Players dive into stealth combat, maneuvering Ninja Cat through narrow alleys and dodging guard dogs in a setting full of obstacles and challenges. With a mix of parkour-like agility and expert shooting, players aim to reach a celebratory ending back in the village.

REFLECTION:
Reflecting on the project, I am pleased with the world-building and the balance of narrative and action. The use of comics and the sequential storytelling between gameplay scenes helped create a sense of progression and immersion. However, there are areas where I would like to improve the game, particularly around the variety of levels and enemy types to keep players more engaged as they advance. Adding additional enemy behaviors, such as dogs with specific attack patterns or power-ups, could add depth to the experience. Other than that, The challege that I faced was from the bullet collision and the enemy. Somehow the code did not work and I have no clue how to fix this. However, if the bullet are scattered around everywhere it is possible to win. 

In conclusion, Shooter Cat served as a valuable project that sharpened my skills in character development, level design, and interactive storytelling. I’ve learned the importance of testing and iteration to refine player controls and improve game balance. Moving forward, I hope to expand on this project by introducing more sophisticated mechanics and further developing the narrative to enrich player engagement and satisfaction.
