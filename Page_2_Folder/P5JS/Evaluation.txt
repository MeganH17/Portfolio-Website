Evaluation:

Through this project I have learned a lot about the coordination and understanding the different funtion use. In my design process I was clearly planning on making a frog since I have always adored cute frog character. Afterwards I made my sketch on the template and stated working on my code.

At first, I struggeled in making the frog because for some reason I made the frog slightly to the side, which make the other shapes to be harder to make. however after learning that I can divide the mouseX and mouseY to make the shape stay in a way that we want, I started to understand and one by one building it into a cute frog. 

For the future I think I want to make sure before adding anything I have to make my base in the middle so it would be easier to deal with later on.
