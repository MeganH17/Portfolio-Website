*Write a description for your experimental clock. How is it novel to you and how might it alter the way you track / keep time?*

This clock is a clock that I made to never stop and always loops, even though there is a botton to stop one of the circle to move, I made the others to keep moving. This clock is meant for people who wants to feel rushed. 




*Describe your design process. Include all three of your design sketches and explain how you’ve ended up choosing one.*

My design process was at first brainstorming at least 3 ideas from my daily life. Here are the ideas:
- The clock that changes because of the darkness or the brightness of the screen
- The clock that rewinds every time it hits 1 minute
- A clock that never stops (still uses hour, minute second)
I ended up choosing the last one (nonstop clock) because I like how chaotic and fun a clock that never stop is. Moreover the more I look at this design, I think personally this clock would help me feel rushed and anxiety while looking at it. 




*What’s your overall reflection on this assignment? What have you learned throughout the process of designing an unconventional clock?*

 I learn more everyday through these assignments.From this process I learn more how to use the boolean and also the if statements to make movements of my rectangle and breathing circle. I made this clock to be chaotic I made it with the plan of putting it as a wallpaper of my devices when I need to do homework to make a rushing vibe. Even though it looks like a random clock, the setting of this clock still uses the usual hour, minute, and second, however the visual around it made it to look more chaotic.
