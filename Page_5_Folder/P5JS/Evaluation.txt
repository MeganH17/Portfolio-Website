In this project I created an illusion of eyes that can make the viewer quite dizzy and hypnotized. I really liked the idea of the black and white eye illusion that made my eyes interested inlooking into it, so in this project I made the first black and white illusion. Then to make it more interesting I also added the second illusion, which is; when the player presses the screen then its appearance will change into a second illusion consisting of colorful circles.
From how I imagine I want my optical illution to be a background of an event screen, it could be for a lyrics video background or some sort because it would make the singer to focus. 

Reflection:

I learned to use nested for loops which I found quite challenging. In addition, I also use booleans to swipe the screen when typing. I think this task is quite simple and I feel happy with the results I have. For the next assignment I will definetly include the nested for loops in order to make an interesting animation.
